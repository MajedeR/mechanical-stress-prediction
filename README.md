# Mechanical Stress Prediction using ML

This project aims to predict the mechanical stress or strain of Aluminum 6061-T651 alloy parts using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains mechanical properties and design features of the Aluminum 6061-T651 alloy.

## Goals
- Preprocess and clean real-world material data
- Train machine learning models to predict stress/strain
- Evaluate and visualize model performance
- Document the process for resume and portfolio use

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Status
ðŸš§ In Progress
